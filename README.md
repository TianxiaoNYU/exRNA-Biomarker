# exRNA-Biomarker: A novel exRNA panel for cancer diagnosis
## This is the sample code for constructing a pipeline for novel exRNA biomarkers analysis, especially conbined with machine learning!

### What does it have
- Since raw data are quite large, here we cannot present whole pieces. More details in ~/data
- Basic codes can be found in ~/pipeline_code, including every essential part among the whole analysis.

### What can it do
- Find novel exRNA biomarkers for different cancers in the provided data
- Achieve above functions in more than one way: offering 3 machine learning models and several matrix processing methods, it can give more choices.

### What's next
- This is just a uncompleted version of the whole software. If searching for more details, please contact [Lulab](http://bioinfo.life.tsinghua.edu.cn/home/)
